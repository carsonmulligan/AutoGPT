Feature selection: In addition to selecting the relevant columns for the model using integer indexing, it may be useful to perform feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis or principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the most important features for predicting stock prices.\n",

Model selection and hyperparameter tuning: While linear regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for regression tasks, there are many other algorithms that can be tried, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. It's also important to tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques such as grid search or randomized search to optimize its performance.\n",
